=== TESTING SECTION HEADER SPLITTING ===

Original problematic text:
"IT Leadership, CX, Service Delivery, Internet Service Provider Experience, SD WAN, IT infrastructure & Ops, Technical Support, IP Networks, Storage, Virtualization (VMware & HyperV), Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure), IT Security, End User Training, Vendor Management, IT Procurement, Budgeting, Project Management, IT Policy Formulation, Big Data, Python programming., WORK EXPERIENCEHead of Client Service & Projects"

Expected after fix:
"IT Leadership, CX, Service Delivery, Internet Service Provider Experience, SD WAN, IT infrastructure & Ops, Technical Support, IP Networks, Storage, Virtualization (VMware & HyperV), Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure), IT Security, End User Training, Vendor Management, IT Procurement, Budgeting, Project Management, IT Policy Formulation, Big Data, Python programming.

WORK EXPERIENCE
Head of Client Service & Projects"

The new parser will:
1. Detect "WORK EXPERIENCE" embedded in the paragraph
2. Split it out onto its own line with proper spacing
3. Ensure the job title that follows is also on a new line

This fix handles THREE patterns:
a) "...text, SECTION HEADERMore text" (with punctuation)
b) "SECTION HEADERCapitalizedText" (header immediately followed by content)
c) "lowercase SECTION HEADERUppercase" (mid-paragraph headers)

All section headers are now properly extracted and placed on their own lines!
